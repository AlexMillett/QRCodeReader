<h1>QR Code Reader</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project takes in images of QR codes and is able to discreetize each of the binary squares and read QR codes.  This project was incredibly exciting as it has many practical applications and there were so many components to getting it to work.  An interesting part of this project was identifying the three anchors and then orienting the image correctly in 2D space to make it discreetizable.
